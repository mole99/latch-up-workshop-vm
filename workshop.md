# Latch-Up Workshop

Welcome to the Latch-Up workshop for CACE!

If you are using the VM, all tools are already pre-installed and CACE is ready to use.

You will find two example projects in your home directory:

- `sky130_ef_ip__instramp`
- `sky130_ef_ip__rdac3v_8bit`

You can enter either directory and execute `cace-gui` in a terminal. It should open a window with a list of parameters and you should be able to run them.

Have fun!
